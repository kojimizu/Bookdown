# Bookdown materials
Bookdown is a R package, enabling users to publish books. 
Bookdown.org has an archive storing published books based on the bookdown package. 
The below is an simple introduction of useful books for statistical modeling and proeprocessing/feature engineering.

## Caret
### 1: Caret package introduction by Max Kuhn (Bookdown)
A package for ML modeling with pre-processing techniques 
```{R}
# Avaiable from CRAN
install.packages("caret")
```

From Sep 2018 - Oct 2018

## Recipes
A package for pre-processing techniques. 
Introduction materials are from useR2018 by Max Kuhn
```{R}
# Avaiable from CRAN
install.packages("recipes")
```
Furthermore, Max Kuhn has talked about Applied Machine Learning in RStudio::Conf 2017. The material is stored in [this repository](https://github.com/kojimizu/rstudio-conf-2018).
