# Predictive Analysis
### Gradient boosting machines (GBM)

Gradient boosted machines (GBMs) are an extremely popular machine learning algorithm that have proven successful across many domains and is one of the learning methods for winning Kaggle competitions. Whereas [random forest](http://uc-r.github.io/random_forests) build anc ensemble of deepe independent trees, GBMs build an ensemple of shallow and weak successive trees with each tree leading and improving on the previous. 

When combined, these many weak successive trees produce a powerful “committee” that are often hard to beat with other algorithms. This tutorial will cover the fundamentals of GBMs for regression problems.

#### tl;dr

This tutotrial serves as an introduction to the GBMs. This tutorial will cover the following material:

- [Replication Requirements](#GBM_RR): What you’ll need to reproduce the analysis in this tutorial.
- [Advantages & Disadvantages](#GBM_feature): Primary strengths and weaknesses of GBMs.
- [The idea](#GBM_idea): A quick overview of how GBMs work.
- [gbm](#GBM_gbm_pkg): Training and tuning with the gbm package
- [xgboost](#GBM_xgboost_pkg): Training and tuning with the xgboost package
- [h2o](#GBM_h2o_pkg): Training and tuning with the h2o package
- [Learning more](#GBM_Learn): Where you can learn more.

#### Replication requirements {#GBM_RR}

This tutorial leverages the following packages. Some of these packages play a supporting role; however, we demonstrate how to implement GBMs with several different packages and discuss the pros and cons to each.

```{r}

install.packages("rsample")
install.packages("gbm")

install.packages("xgboost")
install.packages("caret")
install.packages("lime")
install.packages("h2o")
install.packages("pdp")

library(rsample)      # data splitting 
library(gbm)          # basic implementation
library(xgboost)      # a faster implementation of gbm
library(caret)        # an aggregator package for performing many machine learning models
library(h2o)          # a java-based platform
library(pdp)          # model visualization
library(ggplot2)      # model visualization
library(lime)         # model visualization
```

To illustrate various GBM concepts, we will use the Ames housing data that has been included in the `AmesHousing` package.

```{r}
# create training(70%) and test (30%) sets 
# Use set.seed for reproducibility

set.seed(123)
ames_split <- initial_split(AmesHousing::make_ames(), prop = .7)
ames_train <- training(ames_split)
ames_test  <- testing(ames_split)
```

__Important notice__: tree-based methods tend to perform well on unprocessed data (i.e., without normalizing, centering, scaling features). In this tutorial, I focus on how to implement GBMs with various packages. Although I do not pre-process the data, realize that you __can__ improve model performance by spending time processing variable attributes.

#### Advantages & Disadvantages {#GBM_feature}

__Advantages__ 
- Often provides predictive accuracy that cannot be beat.
- Lots of flexibility - can optimize on different loss functions and provides several hyperparameter tuning options that make the function fit very flexible.
- No data pre-processing required - often works great with categorical and numerical values as is.
- Handles missing data - imputation not required.

__Disadvantages__
- GBMs will continue improving to minimize all errors. This can overemphasize outliers and cause overfitting. Must use cross-validation to neutralize.
- Computationally expensive - GBMs often require many trees (>1000) which can be time and memory exhaustive.
- The high flexibility results in many parameters that interact and influence heavily the behavior of the approach (number of iterations, tree depth, regularization parameters, etc.). This requires a large grid search during tuning.
- Less interpretable although this is easily addressed with various tools (variable importance, partial dependence plots, LIME, etc.).

#### The idea {#GBM_idea}

Several supervised machine learning models are founded on a single predictive model (i.e., liner regression, penalized models, naive Bayes, support vector machines). Alternatively, other approaches such as bagging and random forests are built on the idea of building an ensemble of models where each individal model predicts the outcome and then the ensemble simply averages the predictive values. The family of boosting methods is based on a different, constructive strategy of ensemble formation.

The main idea of boosting is to add new models to the ensemble __sequentially__. At each particular iteration, a new weak, base-learner model is trained with respect to the error of the whole ensemble learnt so far.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Protected/Data Science/UC Business Analytics/image/boosted-trees-process.png")
```

Let’s discuss each component of the previous sentence in closer detail because they are important.

__Base-learning models__: Boosting is a framework that iteratively improves any weak learning model. Many gradient boosting applications allow you to “plug in” various classes of weak learners at your disposal. In practice however, boosted algorithms almost always use decision trees as the base-learner. Consequently, this tutorial will discuss boosting in the context of regression trees.

__Training weak models__:A weak model is one whose error rate is only slightly better than random guessing. The idea behind boosting is that each sequential model builds a simple weak model to slightly improve the remaining errors. With regards to decision trees, shallow trees represent a weak learner. Commonly, trees with only 1-6 splits are used. Combining many weak models (versus strong ones) has a few benefits:

- Speed: Constructing weak models is computationally cheap.  
- Accuracy improvement: Weak models allow the algorithm to learn slowly; making minor adjustments in new areas where it does not perform well. In general, statistical approaches that learn slowly tend to perform well.  
- Avoids overfitting:Due to making only small incremental improvements with each model in the ensemble, this allows us to stop the learning process as soon as overfitting has been detected (typically by using cross-validation).

__Sequential training with respect to errors__: Boosted trees are grown sequentially; each tree is grown using information from previously grown trees. The basic algorithm for boosted regression trees can be generalized to the following where x represents our features and y represents our response:

1. Fit a decision tree to the data: $F_1(x) = y$
2. We then fit the next decision tree to the residuals of the previous: $h_1(x) = y-F_1(x)$
3. Add this new tree to our algorithm: $F_2(x)=F_1(x) + h_1(x)$,
4. Fir the next decision tree to the residuals of $F_2$: $h_2(x)=y-F_2(x)$
5. Add this new tree to our algorithm: $F_3(x) = F_2(x) + h_1(x)$
6. Continue this process until some mmechasim (i.e., cross-validation) tells us to stop.

The basic algorithm for boosted regression trees can be generalized to the following where the final model is simply a stagewise additive model of $b$ individual regression trees:

$$
f(x) = \Sigma_{b=1}^B{f^b(x)}
$$

To illustrate the behaivor, assume the following $x$ and $y$ observations.  The blue sine wave represents the true underlying function and the points represent observations that include some irriducible error (noise). The boosted prediction illustrates the adjusted predictions after each additional sequential tree is added to the algorithm. Initially, there are large errors which the boosted algorithm improves upon immediately but as the predictions get closer to the true underlying function you see each additional tree make small improvements in different areas across the feature space where errors remain. Towards the end of the gif, the predicted values nearly converge to the true underlying function.

__Gradient descent__

Many algorithms, including decision trees, focus on minimizing the residuals and, therefore, emphasize the MSE loss function. The algorithm discussed in the previous section outlines the approach of sequentially fitting regression trees to minimize the errors. This specific approach is how gradient boosting minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) loss function. 

However, often we wish to focus on other loss functions such as mean absolute error (MAE) or to be able to apply the method to a classification problem with a loss function such as deviance. The name __gradient__ boosting machines come from the fact that this procedure can be generalized to loss functions other than MSE.

Gradient boosting is considered a __gradient descent__ algorithm. Gradient descent is a very generic optimization algorithm capable of finding optimal solutions to a wide range of problems. The general idea of a gradient descent is to tweak parameters iteratively in order to minimize a cost function. Suppose you are a downhill skier racing your friend. 

A good strategy to beat your friend to the bottom is to take the path with the steepest sloep. This is is exactly what gradient descent does - it measures the local gradient of the loss (cost) function for a given set of parameter ($\phi$) and takes steps in the direction of the descending gradient. Once the gradient is zero, we have reached the minimum.

Gradient descent can be performed on any loss function that is differentiable. Consequently, this allows GBMs to optimize different loss functions as desired (see ESL, p. 360 for common loss functions). An important parameter in gradient descent is the size of the steps which is determined by the _learning rate_. If the learning rate is too small, then the algorithm will take many iterations to find the minimum. On the other hand, if the learning rate is too high, you might jump cross the minimum and end up further away than when you started.

Moreover, not all cost functions are convex (bowl shaped). There may be local minimas, plateaus, and other irregular terrain of the loss function that makes finding the global minimum difficult. _Stochastic gradient descent_ can help us address this problem by sampling a fraction of the training observations (typically without replacement) and growing the next tree using that subsample. 

This makes the algorithms faster but the stochastic nature of random sampling also adds some random nature in descending the loss function gradient. Although this randomness does not allow the algorithm to find the absolute global minimum, it can actually helpt the algorithm jump out of local minima and off plateus get near the global minimum.

As we’ll see in the next section, there are several hyperparameter tuning options that allow us to address how we approach the gradient descent of our loss function.

__Tuning__

Part of the beauty and challenges of GBM is that they offer several tuning parameters. The beauty in this is GBMs are highly flexible. The challenge is that they can be time consuming to tune and find the optimal combination of hyperparamters. The most common hyperparameters that you will find in most GBM implementations include:

- __Number of trees__: The total number of trees to fit. GBMs often require many trees; however, unlike random forests GBMs can overfit so the goal is to find the optimal number of trees that minimize the loss function of interest with cross validation. 

- __Depth of trees__; The number $d$ of splits in each tree, which controls the complexity of the boosted ensembles. Often $d=1$ works well, in which case each tree is a stump consisting of a single split. More commonly, $d$ is greater than 1 but is unlikely $d>10$ will be required.

- __Learning rate__: Controls how quickly the algorithm proceeds down the gradient descent. Smaller values reduce the chance of overfitting but also increases the time to find the optimal fit. This is also called _shrinkage_.

- __Subsampling__: Controls whether or not you use a fraction of the available training observations. Using less than 100% of the training observations means you are implementing stochastic gradient descent. This can help to minimize overfitting and keep from getting stuck in a local minimum or plateau of the loss function gradien

Throughout this tutorial you’ll be exposed to additional hyperparameters that are specific to certain packages and can improve performance and/or the efficiency of training and tuning models.

__Package implementation__

There are many packages that implement GBMs and GBM variants. You can find a fairly comprehensive list [here](https://koalaverse.github.io/machine-learning-in-R/gradient-boosting-machines.html#gbm-software-in-r) and at the [CRAN Machine Learning Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MachineLearning.html). However, the most popular implementations which we will cover in this plot include:

- [gbm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gbm/index.html): The original R implementation of GBMs
- [xgboost](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/index.html): A fast and efficient gradient boosting framework (C++ backend)
- [h2o](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gamboostLSS/index.html): A powerful java-based interface that provides parallel distributed algorithms and efficient productionalization.


#### gbm {#GBM_gbm_pkg}

The `gbm` R package is an implementation of extensions to Freund and Schapire’s [AdaBoost algorithm](http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~stan/csi5387/boost-tut-ppr.pdf) and Friedman’s [gradient boosting machine.](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/trebst.pdf) This is the original R implementation of GBM. A presentation is available [here](https://www.slideshare.net/mark_landry/gbm-package-in-r) by Mark Landry.

Features include:

- Stochastic GBM.
- Supports up to 1024 factor levels.
- Supports Classification and regression trees.
- Can incorporate many loss functions.
- Out-of-bag estimator for the optimal number of iterations is provided.
- Easy to overfit since early stopping -functionality is not automated in this package.
- If internal cross-validation is used, this can be parallelized to all cores on the machine.
- Currently undergoing a major refactoring & rewrite (and has been for some time).
- GPL-2/3 License.

__Basic implementation__

`gbm` has two primary training functions - `gbm::gbm` and `gbm::gbm.fit`. The primary difference is that `gbm::gbm` uses the formula interface to specify your model whereas `gbm::gbm.fit` requires the separated x and y matrices. When working with many variables it is more efficient to use the matrix rather than formula interface.

The default settings in `gbm` includes a learning rate (`shrinkage`) of 0.001. This is a very small learning rate and typically requires a large number of trees to find the minimum MSE. However, `gbm` uses a default number of trees of 100, which is rarely sufficient. Consequently, I crank it up to 10,000 trees. The default depth of each tree (`interaction.depth`) is 1, which means we are ensembling a bunch of stumps. Lastly, I also include `cv.folds` to perform a 5 fold cross validation. The model took about 90 seconds to run and the results show that our MSE loss function is minimized with 10,000 trees.

```{r}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# train GBM model
gbm.fit <- gbm(
  formula = Sale_Price ~.,
  distribution = "gaussian",
  data = ames_train,
  n.trees = 10000,
  interaction.depth = 1,
  shrinkage = 0.001,
  cv.folds = 5,
  n.cores = NULL, # will use all cores by default
  verbose = FALSE
)

# print results
print(gbm.fit)
# gbm(formula = Sale_Price ~ ., distribution = "gaussian", data = ames_train, 
##     n.trees = 10000, interaction.depth = 1, shrinkage = 0.001, 
##     cv.folds = 5, verbose = FALSE, n.cores = NULL)
## A gradient boosted model with gaussian loss function.
## 10000 iterations were performed.
## The best cross-validation iteration was 10000.
## There were 80 predictors of which 45 had non-zero influence.
```

The output object is a list containing several modeling and results information. We can access this information with regular indexing; I recommend you take some time to dig around in the object to get comfortable with its components. Here, we see that the minimum CV RMSE is 29133 (this means on average our model is about $29,133 off from the actual sales price) but the plot also illustrates that the CV error is still decreasing at 10,000 trees.

```{r}
# get MSE and compute RMSE
sqrt(min(gbm.fit$cv.error))
## [1] 29133.33

# plot loss function as a result of n trees added to the ensemble
gbm.perf(gbm.fit, method = "cv")
```

In this case, the small learning rate is resulting in very small incremental improvements which means many trees are required. In fact, for the default learning rate and tree depth settings it takes 39,906 trees for the CV error to minimize (~ 5 minutes of run time)!

__Tuning__

However, rarely do the degfault settings suffice. We could tune parameters one at a time to see how the results change. for example, here, I increase the learning rate to take large steps down the gradient descent, reduce the number of trees (since we are reducing the learning rate), and increase the depth of each tree from using a single split to 3 splits. This model takes about 90 seconds to run and achieves a significantly lower RMSE than our initial model with only 1,260 trees.

```{r}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# train GBM model
gbm.fit2 <- gbm(
  formula = Sale_Price ~ .,
  distribution = "gaussian",
  data = ames_train,
  n.trees = 5000,
  interaction.depth = 3,
  shrinkage = 0.1,
  cv.folds = 5,
  n.cores = NULL, # will use all cores by default
  verbose = FALSE
  )  

# find index for n trees with minimum CV error
min_MSE <- which.min(gbm.fit2$cv.error)

# get MSE and compute RMSE
sqrt(gbm.fit2$cv.error[min_MSE])
## [1] 23112.1

# plot loss function as a result of n trees added to the ensemble
gbm.perf(gbm.fit2, method = "cv")
```

However, a better option than manually tweaking hyperparameters one at a time is to perform a grid search which iterates over every combination of hyperparameter values and allows us to assess which combination tends to perform well. To perform a manual grid search, first we want to construct our grid of hyperparameter combinations. We’re going to search across 81 models with varying learning rates and tree depth. I also vary the minimum number of observations allowed in the trees terminal nodes (`n.minobsinnode`) and introduce stochastic gradient descent by allowing `bag.fraction < 1`.

```{r}
# create hyperparameter grid

hyper_grid <- expand.grid(
  shrinkage = c(0.01, .1, .3),
  interaction.depth = c(1,3,5),
  n.minosinnode = c(5,10,15),
  bag.fraction = c(.65, .8,1),
  optimal_trees = 0,        # a place to dump results
  min_RMSE = 0              # a place to dump results
)

# total number of combinations
nrow(hyper_grid)

```

We loop through each hyperparameter combination and apply 5,000 trees. However, to speed up the tuning process, instead of performing 5-fold CV I train on 75% of the training observations and evaluate performance on the remaning 25%. __Important note__: when using `train.fraction` it will take the first Xx % of the data so its important to randomize your rows in case this is any logic behind the ordering of the data (i.e., ordered by neighborhood)

After about 30 minutes of training time our grid search ends and we see a few important results pop out. First, our top model has better performance than our previously fitted model above, with the RMSE nearly $3,000 lower. Second, looking at the top 10 models we see that:

- none of the top models used a learning rate of $0.3$; small incremental steps down the gradient descent appears to work best,
- none of the top models used stumps (`interaction.depth = 1`); there are likely stome important interactions that the deeper trees are able to capture,
- adding a stochastic component with bag.fraction < 1 seems to help; there may be some local minimas in our loss function gradient,
- none of the top models used `n.minobsinnode = 15`; the smaller nodes may allow us to capture pockets of unique feature-price point instances,
- in a few instances we appear to use nearly all 5,000 trees; maybe we should increase this parameter in our next search?

```{r}
# randomize data
random_index <- sample(1:nrow(ames_train), nrow(ames_train))
random_ames_train <- ames_train[random_index,]

# grid search
for (i in 1:nrow(hyper_grid)){
  # reproducibility
  set.seed(123)
  
  # train model
  gbm.tune <- gbm(
    formula = Sale_Price ~.,
    distribution = "gaussian",
    data = random_ames_train,
    n.trees = 5000,
    interaction.depth = hyper_grid$interaction.depth[i],
    shrinkage = hyper_grid$shrinkage[i],
    n.minobsinnode = hyper_grid$n.minosinnode[i],
    bag.fraction = hyper_grid$bag.fraction[i],
    train.fraction = .75,
    n.cores = NULL, # will use all cores by default,
    verbose = FALSE
  )
  
  # add min training error and trees to grid
  hyper_grid$optimal_trees[i] <- which.min(gbm.tune$valid.error)
  hyper_grid$min_RMSE[i] <- sqrt(min(gbm.tune$valid.error))
}

hyper_grid %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(min_RMSE) %>%
  head(10)

```


These results help us to zoom into areas where we can refine our search. Let’s adjust our grid and zoom into closer regions of the values that appear to produce the best results in our previous grid search. This grid contains 81 combinations that we’ll search across.

```{r}
# modify hyperparameter grid
hyper_grid <- expand.grid(
  shrinkage = c(.01, .05, .1),
  interaction.depth = c(3, 5, 7),
  n.minobsinnode = c(5, 7, 10),
  bag.fraction = c(.65, .8, 1), 
  optimal_trees = 0,               # a place to dump results
  min_RMSE = 0                     # a place to dump results
)

# total number of combinations
nrow(hyper_grid)
## [1] 81
```

We can use the same `for` loop as before and perform our grid search. We get pretty similar results as before and, actually, our best model is the same as the best model above with an RMSE just above $20K.

```{r}
# grid search

for (i in 1:nrow(hyper_grid)){
  
  # reproducibility
  set.seed(123)
  
  # train model
  gbm.tune <- gbm(
    formula = Sale_Price ~.,
    distribution = "gaussian",
    data = random_ames_train,
    n.trees = 6000,
    interaction.depth = hyper_grid$interaction.depth[i],
    shrinkage = hyper_grid$shrinkage[i],
    n.minobsinnode = hyper_grid$n.minobsinnode[i],
    bag.fraction = hyper_grid$bag.fraction[i],
    train.fraction = 0.75,
    n.cores = NULL, # will use all cores by default,
    verbose = FALSE
  )
  
  # add min trainining error and trees to grid
  hyper_grid$optimal_trees[i] <- which.min(gbm.tune$valid.error)
  hyper_grid$min_RMSE[i] <- sqrt(min(gbm.tune$valid.error))
  }

hyper_grid %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(min_RMSE) %>% 
  head(10)

```

Once we have found our top model we train a model with those specific parameters. And since the model coveraged at 483 trees I train a cross validated model (to provide a more robust errro estimate) with 1000 trees. The cross-validated error of ~$22K is a better representation of the error we might expect on a new unseen data set.

```{r}
# for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# train GBM model
gbm.fit.final <- gbm(
  formula = Sale_Price ~ .,
  distribution = "gaussian",
  data = ames_train,
  n.trees = 483,
  interaction.depth = 5,
  shrinkage = 0.1,
  n.minobsinnode = 5,
  bag.fraction = .65, 
  train.fraction = 1,
  n.cores = NULL, # will use all cores by default
  verbose = FALSE
  )  
```


__Visualing__

_variable importance_

After re-running our final model we likely want to understand the variables that have the largest influence on sale price. The `summary` method for `gbm` will output a data frame and a plot that shows the most influential variables. `cBars` allows you to adjust the number of variables to show (in order of influence). The default method for computing variable importance is with relative influence

1. `method=relative.influence`: At each split in each tree, `gbm` computes the improvement in the split-criterion (MSE for regression). `gbm` then averages the improvement made by each variable across all the trees that the variable is used. The variables with the largest average decrease in MSE are considered most important.

2. `method = permutation.test.gbm`: For each tree, the OOB sample is passed down the tree and the prediction accuracy is recorded. Then the values for each variable (one at a time) are randomly permuted and the accuracy is again computed. The decrease in accuracy as a result of this randomly “shaking up” of variable values is averaged over all the trees for each variable. The variables with the largest average decrease in accuracy are considered most important.

```{r}
par(mar = c(5, 8, 1, 1))
summary(
  gbm.fit.final, 
  cBars = 10,
  method = relative.influence, # also can use permutation.test.gbm
  las = 2
  )
```


An alternative approach is to use the underdevelopment `vip` package, which provides `ggplot2` plots. `vip` also provides an additional measure of variable importance based on partial dependence measures and is a common variable importance plotting framework for many machine learning models.

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("koalaverse/vip")
vip::vip(gbm.fit.final)

_Partial dependence plots_

After the most relevant variables have been identified the next step is to attemp to understand how the response variable changes based on these variables. For this, we can use partial dependence plots (PDPs) and individual conditional expectation (ICE) curves.

PDPs plot the change in the average predicted values as specified feature(s) vary over their marginal distribution. for example, consider the `Gr_Liv_Area` variable. The PDP plot below displays the average change in predicted sales price as we vary Gr_Liv_Area while holding all other variables constant. This is done by holding all variables constant for each observation in our training data set but then apply the unique values of Gr_Liv_Area for each observation. We then average the sale price across all the observations. This PDP illustrates how the predicted sales price increases as the square footage of the ground floor in a house increases.

```{r}
gbm.fit.final %>% 
  partial(pred.var = "Gr_Liv_Area", 
          n.trees  = gbm.fit.final$n.trees,
          grid.resolution = 100) %>% 
  autoplot(rug = TRUE, train=ames_train)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar)
```

ICE curves are an extension of PDP plots but, rather than plot the average marginal effect on the response variable, we plot the change in the predicted response variable for each observation as we vary each predictor variable. Below shows the regular ICE curve plot (left) and the centered ICE curves (right). When the curves have a wide range of intercepts and are consequently “stacked” on each other, heterogeneity in the response variable values due to marginal changes in the predictor variable of interest can be difficult to discern. The centered ICE can help draw these inferences out and can highlight any strong heterogeneity in our results. The resuts show that most observations follow a common trend as `Gr_Liv_Area` increases; however, the centered ICE plot highlights a few observations that deviate from the common trend.

```{r}

ice1 <- gbm.fit.final %>% 
  partial(
    pred.var = "Gr_Liv_Area",
    n.trees  =  gbm.fit.final$n.trees, 
    grid.resolution = 100,
    ice = TRUE
    ) %>%
  autoplot(rug = TRUE, train = ames_train, alpha = .1) +
  ggtitle("Non-centered") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)

ice2 <- gbm.fit.final %>%
  partial(
    pred.var = "Gr_Liv_Area", 
    n.trees = gbm.fit.final$n.trees, 
    grid.resolution = 100,
    ice = TRUE
    ) %>%
  autoplot(rug = TRUE, train = ames_train, alpha = .1, center = TRUE) +
  ggtitle("Centered") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)

gridExtra::grid.arrange(ice1, ice2, nrow=1)
```

_LIME_

LIME is a newer procedure for understanding why a prediction resulted in a given value for a single observation. You can read more about LIME [here](http://uc-r.github.io/lime). To use the `lime` package on a `gbm` model we need to define model type and prediction methods.

```{r}
model_type.gbm <- function(x, ...) {
  return("regression")
}

predict_model.gbm <- function(x, newdata, ...) {
  pred <- predict(x, newdata, n.trees = x$n.trees)
  return(as.data.frame(pred))
}
```

We can now apply to our two observations. The results show the predicted value (Case 1:118K, Case 2:161K),local model fit (both are relatively poor), and the most influential variables driving the predicted value for each observation.

```{r}
# get a few observations to perform local interpreation on 
local_obs <- ames_test[1:2,]

# apply LIME
explainer <- lime(ames_train, gbm.fit.final)
explanation <- explain(local_obs, explainer, n_features = 5)
plot_features(explanation)
```

__Predicting__

Once you have decided on a final model you will likely want to use the model to predict on new observations. Like most models, we simply use the `predict` function; however, we also need to supply the number of trees to use (see`?predict.gbm` for details). we see that our RMSE for our test set is very close to the RMSE we obtained to our best `gbm` model.

```{r}
# predict values for test set
pred <- predict(gbm.fit.final, n.trees = gbm.fit.final$n.trees, ames_test)

# results
caret::RMSE(pred, ames_test$Sale_Price)
## [1] 20681.88
```


#### xgboost {#GBM_xgboost_pkg}

The `xgboost` R package proviedes an R API to "Extreme Gradient Boosting", which is an efficient implementation of gradient boosting framework (approxmately faster than `gbm`). The [xgboost/demo](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/tree/master/demo) repository provides a wealth of information. You can also find a fairly comprehensive parameter tuning guide [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/). The xgboost package has been quite popular and successful on Kaggle for data mining competitions.

Features include:

- Provide built-in k-fold cross-validation
- Stochastic GBM with column and row sampling (per split and per tree) for better generalization.
- Includes efficient linear model solver and tree learning algorithms.
- Parallel computation on a single machine.
- Supports various objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking.
- The package is made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define their own objectives easily.
- Apache 2.0 License.

__Basic implementation__

XGBoost only works with matrices that contain all numeric variables; consequentl, we need to one hot encode our data. There are different ways to do this in R (i.e., `Matrix::sparse.model.matrix`, `caret::dummyVars`). but here we will use the `vtreat` package. vtreat is a robust package for data prep and helps to eliminate problems caused by missing values, novel categorical levels that appear in future data sets that were not in the training data, etc. However, `vtreat` is not very intuitive. I will not explain the functionalities but you can find more information :

- https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09477
- https://www.r-bloggers.com/a-demonstration-of-vtreat-data-preparation/
- https://github.com/WinVector/vtreat

The following applies `vtreat` to one-hot encode the training and testing data sets.

```{r}
# variable names
features <- setdiff(names(ames_train), "Sale_Price")

# Create the treatment plan from the training data
treatplan <- vtreat::designTreatmentsZ(ames_train, features, verbose = FALSE)

# Get the "clean" variable naems from the scoreFrame
new_vars <- treatplan %>% 
  magrittr::use_series(scoreFrame) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(code %in% c("clean", "lev")) %>% 
  magrittr::use_series(varName)

# Prepare the training data
features_train <- vtreat::prepare(treatplan, ames_train, varRestriction = new_vars) %>% as.matrix()
response_train <- ames_train$Sale_Price

# Prepare the test data
features_test <- vtreat::prepare(treatplan, ames_test, varRestriction = new_vars) %>% as.matrix()
response_test <- ames_test$Sale_Price

# dimensions of one-hot encoded data
dim(features_train)
## [1] 2051  208
dim(features_test)
## [1] 879 208

```

`xgboost` provides different training functions (i.e. `xgb.train` which is just a wrapper for `xgboost`). However, to train an XGBoost we typically want to use `xgb.cv`, which incorporates cross-validation. The following trains a basic 5-fold cross validated XGBoost model with 1,000 trees. There are many parameters available in `xgb.cv` but the ones you have become more familiar with in this tutorial include the following default values:

- learning date(`eta`): 0.3
- tree depth(`max_depth`):6
- minimum node size(`min_child_weight`):1
- Percent of training data to sample for each tree (`subsample` –> equivalent to `gbm`’s bag.fraction): 100%

```{r}
# reproducibility
set.seed(123)

xgb.fit1 <- xgb.cv(
  data = features_train,
  label = response_train,
  nrounds = 1000,
  nfold = 5,
  objective = "reg:linear",  # for regression models
  verbose = 0               # silent,
)

```

The xgb.fit1 object contains lots of good information. In particular we can assess the `xgb.fit1$evaluation_log` to identify the minimum RMSE and the optimal number of trees for both the training data and the cross-validated error. We can see that the training error continues to decrease to 965 trees where the RMSE nearly reaches zero; however, the cross validated error reaches a minimum RMSE of $27,572 with only 60 trees.

```{r}
# get number of trees that minimize error
xgb.fit1$evaluation_log %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    ntrees.train = which(train_rmse_mean ==min(train_rmse_mean))[1],
    rmse.train   = min(train_rmse_mean),
    ntrees.test  = which(test_rmse_mean == min(test_rmse_mean))[1],
    rmse.test    = min(test_rmse_mean)
  )
##   ntrees.train rmse.train ntrees.test rmse.test
## 1          965  0.5022836          60  27572.31

# plot error vs number trees
ggplot(xgb.fit1$evaluation_log) +
  geom_line(aes(iter, train_rmse_mean), color = "red") +
  geom_line(aes(iter, test_rmse_mean), color = "blue")

```

A nice feature provided by xgb.cv is early stopping. This allows us to tell the function to stop running if the cross validated error does not improve for n continuous trees. For example, the above model could be re-run with the following where we tell it stop if we see no improvement for 10 consecutive trees. This feature will help us speed up the tuning process in the next section.

```{r}
# reproducibility
set.seed(123)

xgb.fit2 <- xgb.cv(
  data = features_train,
  label = response_train,
  nrounds = 1000,
  nfold = 5,
  objective = "reg:linear", # for regression models
  verbose = 0, # silent,
  early_stopping_rounds = 10 # stop if no improvement for 10 consecutive trees
)

# plot error vs number trees 
ggplot(xgb.fit2$evaluation_log)+
  geom_line(aes(iter, train_rmse_mean), color = "red")+
  geom_line(aes(iter, test_rmse_mean), color = "blue")
```

__Tuning__
To tune the XGBoost model we pass parameters as a list object to the `params` argument.
The common parameters include:

- `eta`: controls the learning rate
- `max_depth`: tree depth
- `min_child_weight`: minimum number of observations required in each terminal node
- `subsample`: percent of training data to sample for each tree
- `colsample_bytrees`: percent of columns to sample from for each tree

For example, if we wanted to specify specific values for these parameters we would extend the above model with the following parameters.

```{r}
# create parameter list

# reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# train model
xgb.fit3 <- xgb.cv(
  params = params,
  data = features_train,
  label = response_train,
  nrounds = 1000,
  nfold = 5,
  objective = "reg:linear", # for regression models
  verbose = 0, # silent,
  early_stopping_rounds = 10 # stop if no improvement for 10 consecutive trees
)

# assess results
xgb.fit3$evaluation_log %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    ntrees.train = which(train_rmse_mean == min(train_rmse_mean))[1],
    rmse.train   = min(train_rmse_mean),
    ntrees.test  = which(test_rmse_mean == min(test_rmse_mean))[1],
    rmse.test   = min(test_rmse_mean)
  )
##   ntrees.train rmse.train ntrees.test rmse.test
## 1          180   5891.703         170  24650.17
```

To perform a large search grip, we can follow the same procedure we did with `gbm`. We create our hyperparameter search grid along with columns to dump our results in. Here, I create a pretty large search grid consisting of 576 different hyperparmeter combinations to model.

```{r}
# create hyperparameter grid

hyper_grid <- expand.grid(
  eta = c(.01, .05, .1, .3),
  max_depth = c(1, 3, 5, 7),
  min_child_weight = c(1, 3, 5, 7),
  subsample = c(.65, .8, 1),
  colsample_bytree = c(.8, .9, 1),
  optional_trees = 0, # a place to dump results
  min_RMSE = 0 # a place to dump results
)

nrow(hyper_grid)
# [1] 576
```

Now I apply the same for loop procedure to loop through and apply a XGBoost model for each hyperparameter combination and dump the results in the `hyper_grid` data frame combination and dump the results in the `hyper_grid` data frame. __Important note__: if you plan to run this code, be prepared to run it before going out to eat or going to bed as it is the full seach grid taking 6 hours to run.

```{r eval=FALSE}

# grid search
for (i in 1:nrow(hyper_grid)){
  # create parameter list
  params <- list(
    eta = hyper_grid$eta[i],
    max_depth = hyper_grid$max_depth[i],
    min_child_weight = hyper_grid$min_child_weight[i],
    subsample = hyper_grid$subsample[i],
    colsample_bytree = hyper_grid$colsample_bytree[i]
  )
  
  # reproducibility
  set.seed(123)
  
  # train omdel
  xgb.tune <- xgb.cv(
    params = params,
    data = feature_train, 
    label = response_train,
    nrounds = 5000,
    nfold = 5,
    objective = "reg:linear" # for regression model
    verbose = 0, # silent
    early_stopping_rounds = 10 # stop if no improvement for 10 consecutive trees
  )
  
  # add min training error and trees to grid
  hyper_grid$optimal_trees[i] <- which.min(xgb.tune$evaluation_log$test_rmse_mean)
  hyper_grid$min_RMSE[i] <- min(xgb.tune$evaluation_log$test_rmse_mean)
}

hyper_grid %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(min_RMSE) %>% 
  head(10)
##     eta max_depth min_child_weight subsample colsample_bytree optimal_trees min_RMSE
## 1  0.01         5                5      0.65                1          1576 23548.84

## 8  0.01         7                5      0.65                1          1248 23792.65

```

After assessing the results you would like to perform a few more grid searches to hone in on the parameters that appear to influence the model the most. In fact, [here is a link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/) to a greate blo post that discusses a strategic approach to tuning with `xgboost`. However, for brevity, we will just assume the top model in the above search is the global optimal model. Once you have found the optimal model, we can fit our final model with `xgb.train`.

```{r}
#  parameter list
params <- list(
  eta = 0.01,
  max_depth = 5,
  min_child_weight = 5,
  subsample = 0.65,
  colsample_bytree = 1
)

# train final model
xgb.fit.final <- xgboost(
  params = params,
  data = features_train,
  label = response_train,
  nrounds = 1576,
  objective = "reg:linear",
  verbose = 0
)
```

__Visualizing__
__variable importance__

`xgboost` provides built-in variable importance plotting. First, you need to create the importance matrix with `xgb.importance` and then feed this matrix into `xgb.plot.importance`. There are 3 variable importance measures:

- Gain: the relative contribution of the corresponding feature to the model calculated by taking each feature’s contribution for each tree in the model. This is synonymous with `gbm`’s `relative.influence`.
- Cover:  the relative number of observations related to this feature. For example, if you have 100 observations, 4 features and 3 trees, and suppose feature1 is used to decide the leaf node for 10, 5, and 2 observations in tree1, tree2 and tree3 respectively; then the metric will count cover for this feature as 10+5+2 = 17 observations. This will be calculated for all the 4 features and the cover will be 17 expressed as a percentage for all features’ cover metrics.
- Frequency: the percentage representing the relative number of times a particular feature occurs in the trees of the model. In the above example, if feature1 occurred in 2 splits, 1 split and 3 splits in each of tree1, tree2 and tree3; then the weightage for feature1 will be 2+1+3 = 6. The frequency for feature1 is calculated as its percentage weight over weights of all features.

```{r}
# create importance matrix
importance_matrix <- xgb.importance(
  model = xgb.fit.final)

# variable importance plot
xgb.plot.importance(importance_matrix, top_n=10, measure = "Gain")
```

__Partial dependence plots__

PDP and ICE plots work similarly to how we implemented them with `gbm`. The only difference is you need to incorporate data within the `partial` function.

```{r}
pdp <- xgb.fit.final %>% 
  partial(pred.var = "Gr_Liv_Area_clean", 
          n.trees = 1576, 
          grid.resolution = 100, 
          train = features_train) %>% 
  autoplot(rug = TRUE, train = features_train) %>% 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)+
  ggtitle("PDP")

ice <- xgb.fit.final %>% 
  partial(pred.var = "Gr_Liv_Area_clean",
          n.trees = 1576, 
          grid.resolution = 100,
          train = features_train,
          ice = TRUE) %>% 
  autoplot(rug = TRUE, 
           train = features_train,
           alpha = .1,
           center = TRUE)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar)+
  ggtitle("ICE")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(pdp, ice, nrow = 1)
```

__LIME__

LIME provides built-in functionality for `xgboost` objects (see `?model_type`). However, just keep in mind that the local observations being analyzed need to ne one-hot encoded in the same manner, as we prepared the raining and test data. Also, when you feed the training data into the `lime::lime` function be sure that you coerce it from a matrix to a data frame.

```{r}
# one-hot encode the local observations to be assessed.
local_obs_onehot <- vtreat::prepare(treatplan, local_obs, vaRestriction = new_vars)
# install.packages("vtreat")

# apply LIME
explainer <- lime(data.frame(features_train), xgb.fit.final)
explanation <- explain(local_obs_onehot,  explainer, n_features = 5)
plot_features(explanation)

```

__Predicting__

Lastly, we use `predict` to predict on new observations. owever, unlike `gbm` we do not need to provide the number of trees. Our test set RMSE is only about $600 different than that produced by our `gbm` model.

```{r}
# predict values for test data
pred <- predict(xgb.fit.final, features_test)

# results
caret::RMSE(pred, response_test)
```

#### h2o {#GBM_h2o_pkg}

The `h2o` package is a powerful and efficient java-based interface that allows for local and cluster-based deployment. It comes with fairly comprehensive [online resource](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/index.html) that includes methodology and code documentation along with tutorial.

Features include:

- Distributed and parallelized computation on either a single node or a multi-node cluster.
- Automatic early stopping based on convergence of user-specified metrics to user-specified relative tolerance.
- Stochastic GBM with column and row sampling (per split and per tree) for better generalization.
- Support for exponential families (Poisson, Gamma, Tweedie) and loss functions in addition to binomial (Bernoulli), Gaussian and multinomial distributions, such as Quantile regression (including Laplace).
- Grid search for hyperparameter optimization and model selection.
- Data-distributed, which means the entire dataset does not need to fit into memory on a single node, hence scales to any size training set.
- Uses histogram approximations of continuous variables for speedup.
- Uses dynamic binning - bin limits are reset at each tree level based on the split bins’ min and max values discovered during the last pass.
- Uses squared error to determine optimal splits.
- Distributed implementation details outlined in a blog post by Cliff Click.
- Unlimited factor levels.
- Multiclass trees (one for each class) built in parallel with each other.
- Apache 2.0 Licensed.
- Model export in plain Java code for deployment in production environments.
